This tool is designed to operate with large texts, dividing it in 'pages' and storing the positions in localStorage.
The texts can be from Project Gutenberg in their raw form, so eventually I could download them directly from there, or one of the mirrors.



Build and run server:  
`elm-live Typelm.elm --output=elm.js`

(Needed because The texts are requested locally with HTTP)
